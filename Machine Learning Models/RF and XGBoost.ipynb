    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",

    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
